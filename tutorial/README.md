## Tutorial

There are several folders here. The basic example shows how to run a RN (or slightly-off RN) solution on an analytically provided background. 

The more complicated example goes through extrapolating a series of backgrounds from a given background.

The required equations are provided in AllEquations, SolveNDWithFiniteDifferences.py is the file that will run the final computation
