# HoloLattices
A generic code design for  to solve the problems typically arising in applications of holography to condensed matter systems. It consists of
a set of initialization blocks, which include importing the form of equations from Mathematica (or elsewhere), setting up the grid and choosing the initial solution
and the parameters of the problem; and the internal loop, where the solution is found after several iterations.
